So far I have implemented separable convolution, and Sobel edge detection. I only have a Gaussian filter implemented currently, but I plan on implementing a box filter as well. For edge detection, I will try using library functions or blurring the image before applying the Sobel filter. For 3, I translate the code for feature matching to Python from MATLAB, but I will also try using correlations (which I also have (written in MATLAB)). For Exercise 4, following discussion on Feb 12, I will add noise the template or the image and see how that affects the ROC curve.
